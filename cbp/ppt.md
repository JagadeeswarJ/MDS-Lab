# Slide 1
Stock price prediction is difficult due to:

High volatility & uncertainty

Non-linear, time-dependent behavior

External factors (news, economy, politics)

Traditional methods (Moving Average, ARIMA) are limited

Objective: Compare Machine Learning (Linear Regression) vs Deep Learning (LSTM)

# Slide 2
Data Collection: Yahoo Finance / Kaggle (OHLCV, Moving Averages)

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scaling, train-test split

Models:

Baseline → Linear Regression

Advanced → LSTM for sequential prediction

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE

Visualization: Actual vs Predicted prices

# Slide 3
Step 1: Collect stock data

Step 2: Preprocess (cleaning, normalization, feature engineering)

Step 3: Train Linear Regression → baseline accuracy

Step 4: Train LSTM → capture temporal patterns

Step 5: Compare results (graphs + metrics)

Step 6: Conclude → LSTM outperforms, but limitations remain due to external shocks
